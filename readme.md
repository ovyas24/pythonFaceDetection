## Python Code For Detecting Face and Eyes 

It is a very simple and easy program to make

## step 1 
You will need to install opencv on your machine
(if already installed skip this step)

~~~python
pip install opencv-python
~~~

## step 2
Use my code to use opencv to detect face and eyes.
In this project I am using harcascade. which are pretrain model for face and eyes

You and Download my repository to get the Harcascade which are used in project.

or if you want to use this code to detect diffrent or multiple things you can attach your own harcascade.
To get harcascade you can visit the link below:
